# Personal page with plans to create ready-to-use components for development

### [Result](https://cucusenok.github.io/)

## Road Map

1. Refactoring and optimization
2. Move components to the library
3. SSR friendly, [Fresnel](https://github.com/artsy/fresnel) for media queries and condition rendering with viewport. Maybe will better solutions.
4. Create a search-tooltip component for searching in technologies stack. 
Possible to use [tags dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaacwen/stack-overflow-tags-data)
or [stackexchange](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow), [an example](https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/edit/1697139)
5. Maybe use [notion.so](https://www.notion.so/) for creation of posts and use [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/)
6. Full search on the site. Look on `/src/Components/Typography/SearchableTypography.tsx`.
I han several experiments with [fusejs](https://fusejs.io/), for fuzzy-searching on the client side.
I rejected this idea because it's look's unusable for searching in Stack/Project, 
but maybe it would be a good solution for full site search
